# CV
MTech student specializing in Digital Electronics &amp; Communication | IoT Systems Designer | Wireless Comms &amp; Active IRS Researcher | LaTeX Enthusiast

I’m currently pursuing my MTech in Digital Electronics and Communication from Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology. My work revolves around designing and optimizing IoT-based systems using microcontrollers like ESP32, NodeMCU, and Raspberry Pi CM4, with a strong focus on real-time data acquisition, cloud integration, and energy-efficient communication.

My academic research includes performance modeling of Active Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) in multi-user wireless systems. I explore phase optimization, spectral and energy efficiency, and hardware-aware power modeling using MATLAB.

I'm also passionate about creating clean and well-structured documents in LaTeX and enjoy integrating electronics with healthcare-oriented applications—like wearable devices for ECG, heart sound, and pulse monitoring.

Beyond academics, I'm enthusiastic about entrepreneurship, helping others build online platforms, and exploring new tech in embedded systems and wireless networks.
